#Why Do I Want Less?

Less has alot of features that make css easier:
Features | Uses
---------|-----
Variables | Usefull for colours
Inherited | Borrow from another class to make a new child class
Nesting | Reduce Repetition by creating a higherarchy
Functionality | Create Classes that Dynamically Change
Inline Comments | Use "//" instead of "/*...*/"
